OdinsHat .vimrc
===============
Just the .vimrc file I use across most of my machines for 
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/) ~7.4.
Although I now prefer and use the excellent 
[Sublime text editor](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) when I can.

I've since moved to [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) (as opposed to Vim8).

Requirements
------------
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) - Vim plugin manager.

  Installing Vundle to make this vimrc work just requires tjhe following 
  command:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
  
  After that open vim and run the following command:
  
  `:PluginInstall`
